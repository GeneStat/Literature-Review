# Literature Review

This repository is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](LICENSE).

## Motivation

We started this repository to keep tracking related cutting-edge papers to find out the topic(s) and scientific questions to work on.

There are too many things worth investigating, nearly everywhere and anytime. We need to keep our curiosity and keep thinking about why and how to answer the why. Every question could be a good question, and there is no stupid question. What affects our decision is only about the strategies or methods for answering the questions.

Therefore, for our (virtual) team, the best question should be like this:

1. We like the field, and we believe in the value of answering the question.
2. We can get the data (public data, or new data we could generate by ourselves) that are required to answer the question.
3. The research procedure could be done by using our skills or experience (programming and statistics, so far).

## Paper List

Here goes a continuous updating paper list. We select at least ten papers to study every month. Unless it is crucial and necessary, only open access papers are selected and added to this list. Suggestion reasons and related comments are provided following each paper.

### December 2021

1. Abdelkader, W. *et al*. A Deep Learning Approach to Refine the Identification of High-Quality Clinical Research Articles From the Biomedical Literature: Protocol for Algorithm Development and Validation. **JMIR Res. Protoc**. 10, e29398 (2021). doi: [10.2196/29398](https://doi.org/10.2196/29398)

    This paper is added for Linlin's personal interest. There are so many new papers published every day. Sooner or later, we need AI to help us to select papers, or even read and understand the papers.

2. Beck, T. *et al*. Auto-CORPus: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Standardising and Reusing Biomedical Literature. **bioRxiv** 2021.01.08.425887 (2021) doi: [10.1101/2021.01.08.425887](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.425887)

    Although this is not even a research article paper, I added it here because I think it is crucial for us, a loosely connected virtual team. We want to do something innovative as well as in an open way. Sooner or later, financial supporting will be a critical problem, which could affect some of our decisions. So, keep caution and keep thinking about what value we could create and transfer, and then we should go further.

5. Kleanthous, S. *et al*. Perception of fairness in algorithmic decisions: Future developers’ perspective. **Patterns**. 0, 100380 (2021). doi: [10.1016/j.patter.2021.100380](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100380)

    In this beginning month of our literature review journey, I tend to add some papers which may be helpful for us to build up our principles and core values.
