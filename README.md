# Literature Review

## Motivation

We started this repository to keep tracking related cutting-edge papers to find out the topic(s) and scientific questions to work on.

There are too many things worth investigating, nearly everywhere and anytime. We need to keep our curiosity and keep thinking about why and how to answer the why. Every question could be a good question, and there is no stupid question. What affects our decision is only about the strategies or methods for answering the questions.

Therefore, for our (virtual) team, the best question should be like this:

1. We like the field, and we believe in the value of answering the question.
2. We can get the data (public data, or new data we could generate by ourselves) that are required to answer the question.
3. The research procedure could be done by using our skills or experience (programming and statistics, so far).

## Paper List

Here goes a continuous updating paper list. We select at least ten papers to study every month. Suggestion reasons and related comments are provided following each paper.

### November 2021

1. Masum, H. et al. Ten Simple Rules for Cultivating Open Science and Collaborative R&D. **PLoS Comput. Biol**. 9, 7â€“10 (2013). doi: [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003244](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003244)

    Since our goal is to do scientific research **openly and transparently**, this paper should be a proper kick-off for this journey.

2. Rollin, G., Lages, J. & Shepelyansky, D. L. Wikipedia network analysis of cancer interactions and world influence. **PLoS One**. 14, e0222508 (2019). doi: [10.1371/journal.pone.0222508](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222508)

    Wikipedia provides an easy-to-access and large data source for us to know a new field quickly and mining for knowledge. This paper is an example of how to launch an analysis of Wikipedia data.

3. Pantziarka, P., Capistrano I, R., De Potter, A., Vandeborne, L. & Bouche, G. An Open Access Database of Licensed Cancer Drugs. **Front. Pharmacol**. 0, 236 (2021). doi: [10.3389/fphar.2021.627574](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.627574)

    For public data mining, we usually generate an open-access database as the final product. The database could elevate other investigators' research.
