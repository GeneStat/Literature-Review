# Literature Review

## Motivation

We started this repository to keep tracking related cutting-edge papers to find out the topic(s) and scientific questions to work on.

There are too many things worth investigating, nearly everywhere and anytime. We need to keep our curiosity and keep thinking about why and how to answer the why. Every question could be a good question, and there is no stupid question. What affects our decision is only about the strategies or methods for answering the questions.

Therefore, for our (virtual) team, the best question should be like this:

1. We like the field, and we believe in the value of answering the question.
2. We can get the data (public data, or new data we could generate by ourselves) that are required to answer the question.
3. The research procedure could be done by using our skills or experience (programming and statistics, so far).
